            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This Boiled Potatoes Recipe is the easiest way to cook potatoes 
                and there is no peeling required. New potatoes are the best for 
                boiling because they have delicate skins and are so creamy and 
                buttery in the center. These potatoes are excellent drizzled 
                with melted butter, extra virgin olive oil, and sprinkled with 
                kosher salt and herbs.</p>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Wash and scrub potatoes and cut larger potatoes in halves or 
                    even quarters so the potato pieces are even-sized.</li>
                <li>Place potatoes in a pot of water with 1 Tbsp salt and cover 
                    with an inch of water. Bring to a boil then reduce heat and simmer 
                    until potatoes are fork tender (10-18 minutes depending on size).</li>
                <li>Drain potatoes and return them to the pot, or a mixing bowl.</li>
                <li>Drizzle melted butter and olive oil over potatoes.</li>
                <li>Season to taste with kosher salt and black pepper.</li>
                <li>Garnish with a freshly chopped parsley and toss to combine. Keep 
                    covered until ready to serve.</li>
