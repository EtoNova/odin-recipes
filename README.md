# Potato Recipes

This project is a simple recipe website built as part of my early HTML learning journey through The Odin Project. The goal of this project is to practice creating a basic website structure using HTML, with recent updates to include CSS for styling.

## Project Overview
The website consists of a main homepage that links to three individual recipe pages. Each recipe page includes:
- A title and image of the finished dish
- A brief description of the recipe
- An unordered list of ingredients
- An ordered list of preparation steps
- A relative link back to the homepage for easy navigation
- An absolute link to the original recipe

The website is styled with CSS to improve the overall design and layout, including:
- The main title is now centered on the page for a cleaner look.
- Added more space around section headings to make everything easier to read.
- All images are centered for a neat appearance.
- Each section (like description, ingredients, and steps) now has its own background color
- Navigation links are styled as buttons, and they change color when you hover over them. The links are also spaced out for a more organized layout.

This project serves as a foundation for building more complex websites in the future.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Creating HTML files with standard boilerplate structure
- Using headings, paragraphs, and lists (ordered and unordered)
- Adding images to web pages
- Working with relative links between pages and absolute links
- Organizing files and directories for a multi-page website
- Adding and applying CSS to style the website
