# Potato Recipes

This project is a simple recipe website built as part of my early HTML learning journey through The Odin Project. The goal of this project is to practice creating a basic website structure using only HTML.

## Project Overview
The website consists of a main homepage that links to three individual recipe pages. Each recipe page includes:
- A title and image of the finished dish
- A brief description of the recipe
- An unordered list of ingredients
- An ordered list of preparation steps
- A relative link back to the homepage for easy navigation
- An absolute link to the original recipe

This project serves as a foundation for building more complex websites in the future.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Creating HTML files with standard boilerplate structure
- Using headings, paragraphs, and lists (ordered and unordered)
- Adding images to web pages
- Working with relative links between pages and absolute links
- Organizing files and directories for a multi-page website
